------------

* Randomize hash seed to prevent some kind of attacks.  
    Or should [MurmurHash][murmur] be replaced with [SipHash][siphash]?  
    &lt;p /&gt;

* Replicate CAS unique values.  
    Currently, yrmcds does not replicate CAS values, which may lead to
    **false-positives** as well as (harmless) false-negatives.  
    &lt;p /&gt;

* Improve <ref ref="cybozu::hash_map#cybozu::hash_map">cybozu::hash_map</ref>.  
    Possible optimizations are:
    - Use a simple linked-list in a bucket instead of std::vector.
    - Require move-ability of objects to eliminate std::unique_ptr.
    - Pass function objects by reference.  
    &lt;p /&gt;

* Allow eviction to be disabled and honor the memory limit.  
    This is a requirement for in-memory database.  
    &lt;p /&gt;

* Save/load cached objects at program exit/startup.  
    This is another requirement for in-memory database.  
    &lt;p /&gt;

* Save snapshots periodically.  
    This can be done by [forking][fork] a child process periodically.  
    To workaround multi-threading issues, we have already prepared:
    - <ref ref="cybozu::hash_map#cybozu::hash_map">cybozu::hash_map</ref> equips no-locking member functions.
    - New file descriptors are created with close-on-exec flag set.  
    &lt;p /&gt;
