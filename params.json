{"name":"yrmcds","tagline":"memcached compatible KVS with master/slave replication.","body":"## Want high availability for memcached? &nbsp;&nbsp; **yrmcds is it**.\r\n\r\nyrmcds is a memory object caching system with master/slave replication.\r\nSince its protocol is perfectly compatible with that of [memcached][],\r\nyrmcds can be used as a drop-in replacement for [memcached][].\r\n\r\nThe biggest benefit of yrmcds is its amazingly low cost replication system.\r\nThe master server is elected dynamically from a group of servers, which\r\neliminates static master/slave configurations.  By adopting virtual-IP\r\nbased replication, no modifications to applications are required.\r\n\r\nUnlike [repcached][], yrmcds is not a patch for memcached.  No piece of\r\ncode are shared between yrmcds and memcached.  yrmcds is developed for\r\n[cybozu.com][cybozu], a B2B cloud service widely adopted by companies in\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\n* Memcached text and binary protocols.  \r\n    Almost all commands are implemented including undocumented `Touch`, `GaT`, and `GaTK` binary commands.\r\n* Large objects can be stored in temporary files, not in memory.\r\n* Virtual-IP based master-slave replication.\r\n* Automatic fail-over.\r\n* Automatic recovery of redundancy.\r\n\r\n### Documents\r\nHTML documents are available [here](html/).  \r\n<small><span style=\"font-color: red;\">(WARNING: IE10 will die!)</span></small>\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nPlease use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/cybozu/yrmcds/issues).\r\n\r\n### Authors and License\r\nThe primary author is @ymmt2005 ([twitter](https://twitter.com/ymmt2005)) at [Cybozu](http://www.cybozu.com/us/).\r\n\r\nThis software is licensed under [the BSD 2-clause license](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).\r\n\r\n[memcached]: http://memcached.org/\r\n[repcached]: http://repcached.lab.klab.org/\r\n[cybozu]: https://www.cybozu.com/us/\r\n","google":"UA-42201828-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
